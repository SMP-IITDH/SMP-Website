					Inside Campus
				</h2>
				<h3>
					Transist Campus
				</h3>
				Our temporary campus accommodates a fully functional academic building, hostels, a gymkhana,
				workshops, fields and much more. The academic building is 3 stories high. There is a well stocked
				library with all the necessary books. There are well
				equipped labs for various disciplines which include two Computer labs, a Physics Lab, a Chemistry
				Lab, a Fluid Dynamics Lab, a Mechanical Workshop, a Strength of Materials Lab, a Heat Transfer Lab,
				a Measurements Lab, Electronics Lab,
				Electronics Power Lab, etc. As more courses are being introduced, labs are being established. There
				is a small canteen in the academic building. It is officially supposed to be open till 10:00 pm, but it
				usually closes much earlier. There is also
				a night canteen in the Bhoopali building which will be open till 2:00 am.

				<h3>
					Permanent Campus
				</h3>
		The Karnataka Government has provided about 470 acres of land for the establishment of the permanent campus of IIT Dharwad, which is about 2-3 km away from the transit campus within the WALMI campus. Phase 1A of the permanent campus is completed. There is the administrative building as soon as you enter the campus through the magnificent main gate, then the two academic blocks where labs will be set up, Knowledge and data center where the library is located, the CLT(Central Learning Theatre) where all the classes will be conducted, the CIF(Central Instrumentation Facility), the CIL(Central Instrumentation Lab), indoor sports facility which has two squash courts, four badminton courts, table tennis courts, and a gym, a transit facility, two hostels and also the mess block opposite to the hostels. There is a canteen in the mess block and also a daily essentials store in the hostel. There is also a swimming pool which will be ready soon.

				<h2>
					Nearby Places
				</h2>
The new campus of IIT Dharwad is located 3km from the National Highway, which means there are multiple places to eat and hang out. While there is ample to do, we'll be only covering food and let you explore the rest.


				<h3>Local</h3>
First of all, there is a Cafe Coffee Day opposite our campus. Near the Cafe Coffee Day is Hyderabadi Biryani Restaurant. The biryani here is excellent and reasonably priced. Another nearby place is Roti Ghar. It is a pure veg restaurant. The food is good and fairly priced and the place is hygienic. A little away from the campus (around 4km towards Dharwad) there is a vegetarian cafe called Seven Beans. It can be reached by cycle or by taking a tum-tum. It is a board game cafe where you can play Jenga, Snakes and Ladders, Ludo, etc while eating. It also has a pool table. Around a kilometer away, there is Malabar, which is a non-veg restaurant. Also, around 8-9 km from the campus is a hotel called Dwarwata. The restaurant serves both veg and non-veg food. It is a bit highly priced but the food is good. There is also a rooftop place.


				<h3>Dharwad City</h3>
There is a Dominos and a Pizza Hut in Dharwad. Chilly Chow and Royal Kitchen are the other good restaurants in Dharwad. CrossRoads Bistro is another small meet-up place with delicious ice-creams. Food Island is a food court located nearby the NTTF brts stop and there is a Davangere Benne Dosa joint where you get piping hot buttery masala dosa. There are other food places to go to like Big Mishra Pedha and other street foods. If you are in Dharwad or Hubli it's a must to have Girmit which is the south Indian version of the bhel puri.


				<h3>Hubli</h3>
Hubli, AKA Huballi, can be easily reached now via the BRTS (Chigari) bus service. It is a chain of air-conditioned buses connecting Hubli and Dharwad. It starts from the New Bus Stand in Dharwad. The frequency of buses is very high and the bus stations are clean and sophisticated. The cost of the ticket is around Rs. 25. Hubli being a larger city than Dharwad has a lot more to offer. There is a very scenic lake called Lake Unnakal which has a garden on its banks (not highly recommended though). There is a mall called Urban Oasis which has a multiplex within it. Near this mall, there is also Barbeque Nation. Very close to Urban Oasis, there is another mall called U Mall that has a gaming house that includes bowling, ice hockey, etc, and beside the mall, there are two movie theatres one being a PVR. There is a decently sized decathlon in Hubli with a small concrete turf/basketball court which can be booked. There is also a much larger choice of places to eat in Hubli in general one being a beautiful, aesthetic cafe called Cafe Di'oro which has good food and also a snooker table to play and hangout with friends.

				<h2>
					Hostels
				</h2>
				A lot of you would surely be leaving your house for the first time while others may know a little about hostel culture. In any case a good hostel culture and atmosphere is only going to boost your morale at all times, be it during exams or a festival celebration. At IIT Dharwad the hostels provided are among the best ones among all the IITs (maybe because they’re quite new). The hostels are located right beside the mess block, which also houses a night canteen/bakery so that you can satisfy your late night hunger pangs. A general store is also available in Hostel 1 which stays open until 10:00PM.

The hostels are located at a convenient place, a 5 minute walk from the Central Learning Theater as well as the Indoor Sports Complex.


				<h3>Hostel Allocation</h3>
				Hostel rooms will be allocated to the first year students’ prior to their registration. The respective rooms would be provided to the students right after their registration on the reporting day. Currently, Hostel 1 is allocated for the 2nd year undergraduates and girls, while Hostel 2 is allocated for PhD and M.Tech students along with the first year undergraduate boys.
.

				<h3>Basic Amenities</h3>
				Each room has four cots, tables, chairs, cupboards, two ceiling fans, tubelights and are equipped with 24x7 high speed internet connectivity. Each wing has washrooms with 24x7 running water. There are geysers in the washrooms that provide hot water the entire day. Two washing machines are kept in each wing, along with a dedicated drying area. Indoor games such as Table Tennis, Chess and Carrom are also available in common areas.

				
				<h3>Girls' Hostel</h3>
				Girls' hostel offers a comprehensive range of well-maintained and essential facilities, including two washing machines in each wing, a designated drying area, readily available drinking water cans, and hot water in showers. Ensuring safety, a dedicated security lady is stationed at the front door, while our diligent cleaning staff keeps the rooms, showers, and washrooms clean on a daily basis. We take pride in providing a comfortable and secure living environment where residents can focus on personal growth and well-being.


				<h3>Hostel Activities</h3>
				There are a plethora of activities that go around in the hostels which makes life fun. A variety of festivals like Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Dussehra, Diwali, Makar Sankranti, Teacher’s Day, Women’s Day etc. are celebrated in the hostels, along with flag hoisting on Republic Day and Independence Day, keeping the atmosphere in the hostels vibrant and lively the entire year around. Do participate in whatever intrigues you, of course after having devoted enough time to academics. It helps you in breaking the ice and socializing with your batchmates and seniors as well.

				<h3>Hostel Council</h3>
				All the hostel affairs would be dealt under the supervision of the General Secretary Hostel Affairs (GSHA, whom you will get to know in your orientation programme). There is a Hostel Secretary for each hostel along with floor representatives to make sure all the odd jobs of the hostels are taken care of. Each hostel has its own warden who will be your point of contact for all the issues you are facing in the hostel, which will be announced during the orientation programme. All important contact numbers are displayed on the notice board of the hostels. There will also be a separate Mess Committee which takes care of the menu. There will be a separate Sports Secretary & Cultural Secretary to look after respective matters among the first year students. As far as the apex council is concerned, we have General Secretaries for Sports Affairs, Mess Affairs, Cultural Affairs, Academic Affairs and Hostel Affairs who look after respective matters for the whole institution.

				PS: All hostel buildings and the famous Bhoopali building at IIT Dharwad are named after ragas of
				classical music (along with a number starting from 0 for the Keeravani Hostel) showing the cultural
				background of Dharwad as a birthplace of
				legendary musicians.
